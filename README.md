# A First Course in Computational Physics
by Paul L. DeVries (published in 1994)

## What is this repo?
As simple as me working through a textbook for fun. Not really intended to be useful for anyone but me.

This book is all about Fortran, so I imagine that is mostly what this repo will contain when I finish the book or move on to some other interest
