        A FIRST COURSE IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS was written 
        using Microsoft FORTRAN Version 5.00.  Version 5.10 
        is also available.  We have found inconsistencies 
        between these versions which make it necessary for us 
        to include separate FCCP libraries for each version. 
        As a result, the installation procedure 

                            IS NOT 

        exactly as described in Appendix A of the text.  
        However, the USE of the libraries is unaffected by 
        this complication.



(You can determine which FORTRAN compiler is installed on your 
computer by entering the command FL, with no file name given.  
A copyright notice, containing the Version number, will be 
displayed on your screen.)


If you are using Version 5.00 of the FORTRAN compiler, you 
should now change to the 5_00 directory: 

         cd 5_00 [enter]


If you are using Version 5.10 of the FORTRAN compiler, you 
should now change to the 5_10 directory:

         cd 5_10 [enter]


After changing to the appropriate directory, read the 
README.DOC file located there.
